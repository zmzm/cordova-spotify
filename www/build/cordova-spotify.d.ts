/**
 * Plays a track by its URI.
 *
 * When `positionMs` is < 0, this function immediately throws an error
 * instead of returning a rejected promise.
 *
 * `auth` may change freely during runtime. The plugin will handle the
 * required login / logout processes automatically when a new track is played.
 *
 * @param {string} trackUri The URI of the track to play.
 * @param {AuthorizationData} auth Valid authorization data.
 * @param {number} positionMs The position (in millseconds) to start playing from. Must be >= 0.
 * @returns {Promise<void>} A promise that resolves when the track starts playing.
 * @async
